# OOP-s-Project.py
Introduction :
This project is a basic Expense Tracker application built using Python. It uses OOPâ€™s principles and a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with Tkinter. The goal of this project is to help users keep track of their daily expenses in a structured.

The main challenge was managing the data flow between the GUI and the backend using OOP. I also had to understand how JSON works for saving and loading data. Through this project, I gained better understanding of class design, event handling in Tkinter, and data persistence.

This project gave me hands-on experience with OOP in Python and working with a GUI. It also taught This me practical ways to save and manage data. The expense tracker can be further improved with features like filtering, exporting, or visual charts.
